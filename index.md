### Education
Sichuan University（September 2019 - June 2022）
- college of life science
- Master of Bioinformatics(GPA3.8/4.0)

Sichuan Police College（September 2015 - June 2019）
- college of computer science
- Bachelor of Network Security

### Skill & Research & Project
- Learned C、C++、C#、JAVA、Python and other programming languages and basic operation of Linux system(ubuntu、centos)
- Virtual docking of small molecules and proteins
- Wet lab experience: wide range of cellular、animal and molecular techniques.
- Master’s project 1( graduation dissertation- Screening of small molecule inhibitors of anti-cancer drugs for specific cancer)
1: Screen out the factors highly expressed in specific cancers that can transform or promote cancer progress, select the proteins that are mainly related to the signal pathway interaction of this factor, find the key residues of those protein-protein interaction, select the docking pocket, screen the relevant small molecule compound database through the virtual docking software such as autodockvina, and then verify the free energy through the kinetic software such as GROMACS to obtain the small molecule compounds that can inhibit the interaction of those important proteins in a specific cancer, and by inhibiting the interaction of related proteins in related signaling pathways, the continuous deterioration of specific cancer cells can be prevented, and then cell cycle can be blocked and even apoptosis.
2: validation tests in vitro and the cell, testing the interaction between the purified protein and small molecule inhibitors, conduct cell experiment for those with low Kd value, incubate the cells with small molecule drugs, and detect cell viability, expression level of related proteins, apoptosis, etc. (CCK8, ELISA \ WB, flow cytometry to detect apoptosis)
3: The most effective small molecule compounds were verified in nude mouse animal models (related cancer cells were subcutaneous tumorization, intraperitoneal injection, and tumor volume measurement).
